# Epic Binary Search Visualizer

An interactive and visually appealing web application to demonstrate how the Binary Search algorithm works. The project uses modern web technologies like **TailwindCSS**, **GSAP** for animations, and **Canvas Confetti** for celebratory effects.

## Features
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Create arrays of any size (1-20) with custom inputs.
- **Interactive Search**: Click on a number in the array to set it as the target, or let the system pick one randomly.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the binary search algorithm in action with animations highlighting each step.
- **Time Complexity Display**: The application shows the number of steps taken and the `O(log n)` complexity.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling and responsiveness.
- **GSAP**: Smooth animations for UI interactions.
- **Canvas Confetti**: Adds celebratory effects when the target is found.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taha-daneshmand/epic-binary-search-visualizer.git

   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.

## How to Use
1. Set the array size using the input field (1-20).
2. Input your numbers or let the app generate them randomly.
3. Click "Initiate Search" to start the algorithm.
4. Follow the visual guide to see how binary search operates.
